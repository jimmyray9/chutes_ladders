# Chutes and Ladders 

### Rules
This is a popular childhood game of moving your piece from square 1 at the bottom of the grid to point 100 at the very top of the grid. Two
people play this game at any time. Along the path to get to the final square to win, there are numerous squares that either contain a help (ladder)
which allows the player to climb up to a higher square, or a disadvantage (chute) that makes you slide down to a lower
square. Each player will alternate rolling the two die to move forward and if a player rolls doubles, he/she will go again. In order to win the game
the player must land exactly on square 100. 

The game is simple enough but I wanted a visualization of the game instead of playing on the command line which would not be exciting for children.

### Areas of improvement
1. ~~Allowing players to choose a piece~~
2. Allowing players to upload a picture of them to use as the piece
3. Build the chute from one square to another
4. Build the ladder from one square to another
5. Drag and drop the piece by the user?
6. Add the sound 
7. Add the dice roll (so not just automatically to the finished roll)
